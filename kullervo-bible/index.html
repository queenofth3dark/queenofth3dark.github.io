    <br>I’ve spent long enough playing Kullervo now and creating various builds that I figured it’s probably time to share that elsewhere. So, with that said, here’s an overview of his kit, 5 different builds I’ve created to take advantage of his strengths, and weapon recommendations for each build.

    Abilities
  </h3>
  <p style="color:White;font-size:130%;font-family:Tahoma, sans-serif">
Passve – Kullervo boasts +75% Heavy Attack Efficiency and +100% Heavy Attack Wind Up Speed on a ll melee weapons. This mostly serves as quality of life to make the rest of his kit work better. It’s not gamechanging but you will absolutely notice it during gameplay, and it’s nice to have.<br><br>
Wrathful Advance – Charge a heavy attack, teleport to the target, and attack. You gain 200% flat critical hit chance on melee weapons, applied after all other buffs. And it scales with strength, allowing all of his melee weapons to crit deep into red crit territory with a strength investment. Oh, and it has a tap/hold that allows him to teleport anywhere and not have to heavy attack a specific enemy<br><br>
Recompense – This is how you stay alive. He sends out the daggers from his chest and each one generates a little overguard when hitting an enemy, or damages himself if time runs up before hitting an enemy. The brief invulnerability period on cast and the overguard gate are what allow him to survive into high levels. Recently this ability got an augment that causes the daggers to spin in a circle around him constantly generating overguard, which significantly reduces the amount of maintenance to play him at high levels<br><br>
Collective Curse – Binds enemies together and deals 50% of the damage to any enemy to all others. This scales with strength, easily hitting 100% with a maxed blind rage and literally anything else. The cast does have a line of sight check, though it has a generous range, and there is no line of sight check once enemies are chained together. This combos extremely well with Wrathful Advance, allowing you to chain enemies together and deal massive damage to all of them at once<br><br>
Storm of Ukko – The typical subsume slot, if you’re going to. It causes daggers to fall from the sky in a radius around you, which deal slash procs and increase your melee combo counter. The enemies hit by it will also be staggered, allowing some light cc, though it’s heavily overshadowed by his first 3 abilities in most cases. Worth using on some builds, but it’s the easiest to say goodbye to if needed.

    Build 1 - Standard Melee
  </h3>
  <img src="kullervo-build-1.webp">
  <p style="color:White;font-size:130%;font-family:Tahoma, sans-serif">
  This is my general purpose melee build. Ready steel is some nice quality of life and his abilities will overshadow the benefit of really any aura mod you can slot in there. It’s probably easily replaceable, but on builds such as heavy melee spam, it’s very nice to have. Power drift is there for a similar reason, lack of anything better to put in the slot. Molt Augmented gives an entire extra tier of crit through Wrathful Advance, and Arcane Strike could be replaced by your favorite melee arcane or an Arcane Energize if you find you have energy economy issues, which can happen if using Collective Curse generously enough.<br><br>
  Volatile recompense is included for quality of life as well, as it just makes survival less of a headache in higher levels where overguard’s damage reduction no longer cuts it. The rest of the build serves to have a good amount of duration for Wrathful Advance’s crit buff and a decent amount of range for grabbing enemies with Collective Curse, as well as Primed Flow to reach 500 max energy for violet archon shards. Equilibrium is included for better energy economy, and the rest of the build is devoted to squeezing out as much crit as you can from Wrathful Advance.<br><br>
  This build uses 5 tauforged violet archon shards, all for the melee critical damage buff, as the best thing to pair with ridiculous amounts of crit chance is ridiculous amounts of crit damage. The following 2 builds are also best suited with the same shard setup, though the last few aren't.<br><br>
  Weapon Recommendations:<br>
1. Praedos – Not gonna blow you away in playstyle, but it’s plenty strong and the speed buff is nice to have around<br>
2. Glaive – instead of nuking an area with slash damage, nuke it with massive crit damage<br>
3. Corufell – Kullervo has a gun<br>
4. Hate – already a strong crit melee weapon, boosted to new heights<br>
5. Okina – the ghost daggers will crit really hard, instantly killing enemies<br>
6. Thalys – the exploding shards from evo 5 will now crit<br>
7. Bo – an extremely underrated pick, and while its damage is somewhat unimpressive, the range is and Kullervo more than makes up for the damage issue<br>
8. Magistar – big crit slams are bigger and critter<br>
9. Syam – the projectile’s ability to travel over terrain lets it hit a lot more enemies than most other projectile melees, for faster killing
